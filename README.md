## GitHub - Strigo integration

Showing off how we can integrate a GitHib repo with Strigo

The basic assumption is that we now just provide a way to generate a single class with a single presentation and single AMI's from a repository
by providing the info under .strigo.yml in the root of the repo.

Potential enhancements could be to provide a list of classes, each has a list of presentations and list of AMI's.
